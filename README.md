# Java_Project
Music Player
This project is a basic music player built using JavaFX. It allows users to play, pause, stop, and skip to the next song. The
elapsed time of the current song is displayed, and there is a
shuffle button to randomly play songs from the selected folder.

Next and Previous button for songs are also added.
